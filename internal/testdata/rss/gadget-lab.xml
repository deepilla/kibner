			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a big deal last year when Google came out with its own smartphone, the Pixel. Also one year ago, the tech giant released a smart home speaker and debuted the AI-powered Assistant that lives inside these new gadgets. Now it&#8217;s twelve months later, and Google is stepping on the gas. This week, we saw a new Android flagship phone, the Pixel 2. Also, two new Google Home speakers, a new Chromebook with a button to call the Assistant, some wireless earbuds called Pixel Buds with tap-to-talk functionality for Assistant, an AI-powered camera called Clips. Are we forgetting anything? Google is now truly a hardware player, but it has a powerful software engine running across all of its products. The hosts recap a busy week for the big G.</p>

Tom Simonite on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/siri-why-have-you-fallen-behind-other-digital-assistants/">Siri&#8217;s need to catch up</a>. David writes about how all of Google&#8217;s devices <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/googles-gadget-vision/">kinda do the same thing</a>. <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/usb_c_headphone_adapter?hl=en-US">Pixel 2 USB-C dongles</a> for your headphones.

			<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This week, new hardware and software from Amazon, and Twitter goes long.]]></itunes:subtitle>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon announced a raft of new hardware devices this week, from new Echo speakers and fun arcade buttons that plug into them, to a dangling-dongle version of the Fire TV. The one unifying thread all these devices have? Alexa. As Amazon&#8217;s voice assistant proliferates into more products, Amazon&#8217;s smart home empire grows. But can Alexa find its feet outside the home? David tells us what he saw when he visited the company in Seattle this week. Before that however, we&#8217;ve got 280 bones to pick with Twitter.</p>
<p>Some notes: Meet the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-introduces-a-prettier-bassier-echo/">newest Echo speakers</a>. Get a load of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-new-fire-tv-gives-alexa-one-more-place-to-live/">funny-lookin&#8217; Fire TV</a>. Learn some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-amazon-echo-dot/">Echo tips and tricks</a>. Arielle charts the history of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-brief-history-of-the-ever-expanding-tweet/">ever-expanding tweet</a>. That thumping sound you hear throughout the show is David furiously banging on the table. Recommendations this week: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-north-korea">Evan Osnos on North Korea</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, the <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/"><em>More Perfect</em></a> podcast, and get yourself a damn <a href="http://a.co/1AJVthw">hard drive</a>.

			<googleplay:description><![CDATA[Samsung&#8217;s newest phone, announced this week, is a very big dealâin both physical size and importance. We run down the news on the Galaxy Note 8. Everyone agrees that its release is a huge milestone for Samsung after the debacle of the Note 7. David loves what he&#8217;s seen so far, but Mike has concerns about the software, and Arielle would just like a phone that&#8217;s not bonkers-huge. Also, Arielle has a killer startup idea.
Some notes (ha): David&#8217;s hands-on look at the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Our explainer on why the Note 7 kept exploding. See also our review of the Galaxy S8, the new Note&#8217;s closest cousin. Recommendations this week: The film American Anarchist, the book Powerhouse and Pressed by Kind snacks.
