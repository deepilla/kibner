        <![CDATA[<p>“Kite” is a common term in prison for a written note. Over the course of the season, listeners have been encouraged to send in their questions about Ear Hustle via postcards, or “kites.” In this episode, Earlonne and Nigel dig into the pile of postcards that have arrived from all corners of the world, with some help from guys in the yard. You’ll also hear from a familiar Ear Hustle voice — the man who approves all stories for publication, Lt. Sam Robinson.</p>

<p>Thanks to the following San Quentin inmates for helping catch these kites: Curtis “Wall Street” Carroll, Miguel Fuentes, E. Phil Phillips, Joshua Burton, Luke Colondres, Michael Mackey, Louis A Scott, Tommy Shakur Ross, Eddie Herena, Sha Wallace-Stepter, Rashaan Thomas.</p>

<p>And to San Quentin staff: Officer Reyes and Lt. Sam Robinson</p>

<p>And to music contributors: Jovan Mills (<em>Worth It</em>) and Lee Jasper (<em>Darn that Dream</em>)</p>

<p>Thanks also to listeners who have sent postcards. We can't answer them all, but please know each is read, archived and deeply appreciated. In this episode we tackled questions from: Lucy from New Jersey, Dan from Canada, Adam from the United Kingdom, and one listener who wishes to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>Ear Hustle is produced by Nigel Poor, Antwan Williams and Earlonne Woods with consulting editor Curtis Fox, outside production advisor Pat Mesiti-Miller and executive producer Julie Shapiro.</p>

        <![CDATA[“Kite” is a common term in prison for a written note. Over the course of the season, listeners have been encouraged to send in their questions about Ear Hustle via postcards, or “kites.” In this episode, Earlonne and Nigel dig into the pile of postcards that have arrived from all corners of the world, with some help from guys in the yard. You’ll also hear from a familiar Ear Hustle voice — the man who approves all stories for publication, Lt. Sam Robinson.

Thanks to the following San Quentin inmates for helping catch these kites: Curtis “Wall Street” Carroll, Miguel Fuentes, E. Phil Phillips, Joshua Burton, Luke Colondres, Michael Mackey, Louis A Scott, Tommy Shakur Ross, Eddie Herena, Sha Wallace-Stepter, Rashaan Thomas.

And to San Quentin staff: Officer Reyes and Lt. Sam Robinson

And to music contributors: Jovan Mills (Worth It) and Lee Jasper (Darn that Dream)

Thanks also to listeners who have sent postcards. We can't answer them all, but please know each is read, archived and deeply appreciated. In this episode we tackled questions from: Lucy from New Jersey, Dan from Canada, Adam from the United Kingdom, and one listener who wishes to remain anonymous.

Ear Hustle is produced by Nigel Poor, Antwan Williams and Earlonne Woods with consulting editor Curtis Fox, outside production advisor Pat Mesiti-Miller and executive producer Julie Shapiro.

        <![CDATA[<p>The need to nurture and show love for another living being (or, in San Quentin parlance, “looking out”) is an essential human impulse. Away from your family and friends in prison this can be difficult, if not impossible. Sure, guys create strong bonds among themselves that help to alleviate the pain of missing family. But like on the outside, some people inside just relate better to animals than people.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rauch for sharing his story, and to the guys who contributed to the Yard Talk segments in this episode: Jovon Mills, Kao Chung, Henry Charles, Rahsaan Thomas, Sha Wallace-Stepter, Arnulfo Garcia, Aly Tamboura, Emile DeWeaver, Antwan Williams, E. Phil Phillips, Curtis "WallStreet" Carroll, Donte Smith and Noah. The song "Worth It" was written and performed by Jovan Mills, and Sister Maria is played by Sandy Claire.</p>

        <![CDATA[At San Quentin Prison, the typical cell measures approximately 4’ x 9’ and contains a bunk bed, toilet, sink, two men, and their six cubic feet of belongings. In our first episode of Ear Hustle, hear stories of negotiating this space and the relationships that come with living in such close quarters. Ear Hustle is produced by Nigel Poor, Antwan Williams and Earlonne Woods. Thanks to additional storytellers in this episode: Ron Self (had cellie from hell), Eddie and Emile DeWeaver (brother cellies), Cleo Cloeman (Earlonne's former cellie), Sha Wallace-Stepter &amp; Donte Smith (laughing cellies). Thanks also to Joshua Burton and David Jassy (also incarcerated at San Quentin) for contributing some of the music used throughout Cellies. And thanks to you for tuning into our first episode!
