    <description>Most Americans now have more choices when it comes to food than any other group of people in the history of the world. We are so, so lucky to live in a time and place when we get to choose between feasting on fresh vegetables from the farmer’s market… and ordering a meat lover’s pizza delivered right to our door.

With such a ridiculous abundance of options, how do we actually decide what’s for dinner?

On Why We Eat What We Eat, host Cathy Erway investigates the unseen forces that shape our eating habits. We’ll tackle a kale conspiracy, how to get your kids to quit being so picky, visiting the epicenter of the potluck scene, and more.

Brought to you by Blue Apron and Gimlet Creative.

      <title>The Search for Big Kale</title>
      <description>In our first episode, we take on food trends — specifically, the biggest food trend of the last decade: kale. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kale isn’t an especially flashy vegetable. It’s slightly bitter, hard to digest, and lasts forever in your fridge. Rumor has it that, until 2011, the biggest kale buyer used it to garnish their salad bar. Now, it’s on 1 out of every 5 menus in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something — or someone — catapulted kale into a status symbol. In our quest to find the story of how kale got cool, we’ll trace its rise back nearly 20 years and even, possibly, uncover a full-blown kale conspiracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might think kale is over, but you haven’t heard anything yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
